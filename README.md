## Why Musubi?

Every calendar app treats **sharing as an afterthought**. Google Calendar locks your family into Google. Apple locks them into Apple. CalDAV apps sync, but sharing means emailing `.ics` attachments like it's 2009. And planning something with friends? That somehow still belongs to Facebook.

**Musubi** (結び — *the knot*) starts from the other end: **the people come first, the events tie you together.**

- 🪢 **Events are freed from calendars.** An event isn't trapped in one calendar — link it into your partner's, your team's, your friends'. One dinner, visible everywhere it matters, edited once.
- 🌐 **One node for your whole life.** Work, family, relationship, friends — separate calendars, separate people, one unified view. Your external Google, Outlook, Apple / iCloud, and CalDAV events flow in and out through two-way sync.
- 🏠 **Your server, your data.** Self-host the whole thing with Docker, or use it hosted. No ads, no profile building, MIT-licensed.

Nobody else is building exactly this: **an open calendar designed as social infrastructure, without being a social network.**

## What it does today

| | Feature | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 結 | **Shared calendars** | Invite via link, roles (owner / editor / viewer), ownership transfer, live membership |
| 空 | **Events beyond calendars** | One event in many calendars — link it, fork it, or keep it yours; the origin calendar governs editing |
| 繋 | **Two-way external sync** | Google Calendar, Outlook / Microsoft 365, Apple / iCloud, and any CalDAV server — including recurring events *with exceptions*, read-only detection, multiple accounts |
| 速 | **Realtime** | Changes appear on everyone's device instantly (Server-Sent Events), with an offline-tolerant delta cache underneath |
| 月 | **A calendar UI built from scratch** | Month → day zoom animation, drag-to-create with grab handles, docked quick-composer — Google Calendar fluency, none of the Google |
| 侘 | **Zen aesthetic** | Sumi ink on night / ink on washi paper, spring physics, deliberate haptics, kanji accents |
| 鈴 | **Notifications** | Local reminders that survive edits, moves, and recurrence — even for synced events |
| 卓 | **Android home-screen widgets** | Scrollable Agenda + adaptive month Calendar; recurring occurrences, deep-linked event/day detail, per-widget calendar filters, and light/dark themes |
| 家 | **Self-hosting** | One Postgres + one Node server, `docker-compose.selfhost.yml` included |

### Sync providers

| Provider | Status |
|---|---|
| Google Calendar | ✅ two-way |
| Apple / iCloud | ✅ two-way (CalDAV) |
| Any CalDAV server (Nextcloud, Radicale, Fastmail…) | ✅ two-way |
| Outlook / Microsoft 365 | ✅ two-way (Microsoft Graph) |

## Where it's going

The mobile app + self-hostable server are the foundation. The bigger picture:

- 🚧 **Web client** — a first-class web app, not a mobile afterthought. Power features live here: rich planning views, bulk editing, calendar administration.
- 🚧 **Open events & RSVP** — create an event, share a link. People join as attendees with **just a name and an email**. No account, no app install, no social network. You see who's coming; they get email reminders. *This is our shot at everything Facebook Events used to be — without Facebook.*
- 🚧 **Meetup planning** — find the time that works across everyone's calendars before the event exists.
- 🚧 **Realtime provider push** — webhook-driven sync from Google/Outlook instead of polling (design done, see docs).
- 🔮 **Email notifications, attendance tracking, public event pages.**

Full backlog on the public [feedback and roadmap board](https://feedback.frgtn.dev).

> ⚠️ **Status: early.** Musubi is pre-1.0 and moving fast. It already runs daily on real devices, but expect sharp edges — and please [report them](mailto:hello@frgtn.dev).

## 📱 Try it

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.frgtn.musubi">
  <img alt="Get it on Google Play" src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png" height="64" />
</a>

iOS build is planned once the Android client settles.

## 🏠 Run it yourself

**Requirements:** Node 20+, pnpm 11+, Postgres 15+ (or just Docker).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/f-tuma/Musubi.git && cd Musubi
pnpm install

cp .env.example .env
# set DATABASE_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET at minimum

pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev            # api + client + docs, all in parallel
```

Testing on a real device? Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and the app's server URL (welcome screen) to your machine's LAN IP (`http://192.168.x.x:7531`), not `localhost`. To run the server + database on a plain Docker host, use `docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml up -d` (the repo's default `docker-compose.yml` targets Dokploy). Full guides live in [`packages/docs`](./packages/docs/) and at [musubi.frgtn.dev/docs](https://musubi.frgtn.dev/docs).

## 🧱 How it's built

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Mobile client | React Native 0.85 · Expo SDK 56 · Expo Router · Zustand · Reanimated · custom calendar engine (`apps/client/components/cal`) · native Android `RemoteViews` widgets bridged through a local Expo module |
| Server | Express 5 · [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) · Zod · Server-Sent Events |
| Data | Postgres · [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) · SQLite on-device cache with delta sync |
| Sync engine | Provider-agnostic adapter interface (`CalendarAdapter`) — Google + Microsoft + CalDAV today, yours tomorrow |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces · Turborepo · [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) docs |

## 🤝 Contributing

The most impactful places to jump in:

- **Provider adapters** — Fastmail JMAP, Proton Calendar, anything with an API. The [sync adapter guide](https://musubi.frgtn.dev/docs) walks you through the `CalendarAdapter` interface, field-by-field.
- **The web client** — greenfield, starting soon.
- **Bug reports from real usage** — pre-1.0 gold.

Fork, branch, open a PR against `main`. For bigger ideas, open an issue first so we can talk it through.
