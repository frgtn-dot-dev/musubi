/**
 * Check a response against the shape this build was compiled against.
 *
 * The web has done this since it was written; the phone cast and hoped. That
 * is backwards — the web is a redeploy away from any fix, and a phone build
 * carries whatever it shipped with until its owner updates from the store.
 * The client that cannot be corrected is the one that most needs to notice.
 *
 * Two things come out of it. A response that matches is *converted*, so
 * `event.start` is the `Date` its type has always claimed rather than the
 * string that was actually there. A response that does not match is recorded
 * where someone can read it.
 *
 * ## Why production does not throw
 *
 * Musubi is self-hostable, so "the server is older than the app" is ordinary,
 * not exceptional: someone installs today's build from the store and points it
 * at the server they set up last spring. `minClientVersion` keeps an old app
 * away from a new server; nothing keeps a new app away from an old server, and
 * nothing can.
 *
 * Refusing to render would turn a partly-working app into a dead one for
 * exactly those people. So a mismatch degrades the way it always has, and the
 * gain is that it is now *visible* — in the diagnostics the settings screen
 * copies, which is how a self-hoster's report reaches us at all.
 *
 * In development it throws, because there it can be fixed before it ships.

 * Better Auth's client parses responses with date revival switched on, so every

 * The server sends a string and the browser receives a string; this transport
 * is the odd one out, which is why a schema shared with the web cannot simply
 * say `z.string()` for a time.
 *
 * `z.coerce.date()` fields are unaffected — they take a `Date` happily — so
 * this is only for the places the wire carries a timestamp the code wants to
 * keep as text. `services/eventsCache.ts` had already learned this the hard
 * way: expo-sqlite on iOS throws when asked to bind a `Date`.
