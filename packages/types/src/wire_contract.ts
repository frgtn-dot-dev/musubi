 * Compare a promised contract against the current one.

 * The rule differs by direction, because "breaking" is not symmetric:

 * - **read** — the server may add to what it sends, and a client ignores what
 *   it does not recognise. It may not drop a field, change one, or start
 *   omitting one it always sent.
 * - **write** — the server may accept more, but only if the new field is
 *   optional. A new required field, or a tightened existing one, refuses every
 *   client built before it, and those are out in the world for months.
 *
 * A document that disappears from the registry is a break too: it means
 * something stopped being described, not that it stopped being sent.
