# Google OAuth Verification Tracker

This document tracks the public, non-sensitive work required to verify Musubi's Google OAuth integration.

> Public repository rule: do not add credentials, tokens, private email addresses, unpublished infrastructure details, reviewer credentials, internal account IDs, security keys, or screenshots containing user data.

## Verification target

Musubi requests the following Google Calendar scope:

```text
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
```

The long-term product goal is to provide a full Google Calendar client experience, including event synchronization and management of calendar resources and settings.

Google verification should only be submitted when the review build, public website, privacy policy, Play Store listing, scope justification, and demonstration video all describe the same implemented functionality.

## Current public status

- [x] The mobile client requests the full Google Calendar scope.
- [x] Musubi can list connected Google calendars.
- [x] Musubi supports two-way event synchronization.
- [x] Musubi can create, update, and delete events.
- [x] Users can disconnect a connected calendar account.
- [x] Users can delete their Musubi account in the application.
- [ ] Musubi can create a Google calendar resource.
- [ ] Musubi can update Google calendar properties.
- [ ] Musubi can delete an owned secondary Google calendar.
- [ ] Musubi can modify supported `calendarList` settings.
- [ ] The normal disconnect flow revokes the Google token before deleting local credentials.
- [ ] Google OAuth refresh tokens have verified encryption at rest appropriate for long-lived credentials.

## Submission gate

Do not submit the OAuth verification request until all required P0 items are complete.

### P0 — Calendar client functionality

- [ ] Create a secondary Google calendar from Musubi.
- [ ] Edit the name, description, and time zone of an owned Google calendar.
- [ ] Delete an owned secondary Google calendar with an explicit destructive-action confirmation.
- [ ] Implement at least one meaningful write operation for the user's Google calendar list, such as visibility or another supported per-user setting.
- [ ] Distinguish primary, owner, writer, reader, and free/busy-only access roles.
- [ ] Disable operations that the connected Google account is not authorized to perform.
- [ ] Clearly distinguish these actions in the UI:
  - disconnect from Musubi;
  - remove a calendar from the Google calendar list;
  - permanently delete a Google calendar.
- [ ] Test calendar and event operations against owned, shared, and read-only calendars.
- [ ] Handle Google API authorization errors and expired synchronization cursors safely.

### Optional — Sharing and ACL management

These items are not required for the first submission unless they are used in the scope justification or shown as current product functionality.

- [ ] Display calendar access rules.
- [ ] Add a calendar member.
- [ ] Change a member's access role.
- [ ] Remove a member's access.
- [ ] Enforce ownership and permission checks for every ACL operation.

Do not mention ACL management as an implemented feature until all relevant controls are available in the review build.

### P0 — OAuth and Google Cloud configuration

- [ ] The application, OAuth consent screen, and verification request use exactly the same scope.
- [ ] The authorized domain is the verified top private domain used by the public Musubi website.
- [ ] The domain is verified in Google Search Console by an account with the required project permissions.
- [ ] OAuth branding uses the production Musubi name and logo.
- [ ] Homepage, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and support links are public and accessible without signing in.
- [ ] The application audience and publishing status are appropriate for external production users.
- [ ] The Android OAuth client matches the production package and Google Play App Signing certificate.
- [ ] Backend OAuth redirect URIs are exact, HTTPS-only, and production-safe.
- [ ] Google sign-in and Google Calendar authorization are clearly presented as separate flows.
- [ ] Unused development OAuth clients are removed from the production project.

### P0 — Security and data handling

- [ ] Access and refresh tokens are never written to logs or returned in error responses.
- [ ] Long-lived Google credentials are encrypted at rest using a documented, production-appropriate mechanism.
- [ ] Disconnect attempts Google token revocation and always removes local credentials afterward.
- [ ] Every server-side Google operation verifies ownership of the Musubi user, connected account, and calendar mapping.
- [ ] Destructive calendar operations require explicit user confirmation.
- [ ] The Privacy Policy accurately describes stored calendar metadata, events, synchronization cursors, and OAuth credentials.
- [ ] Account deletion, retention, backup handling, and export statements match the actual implementation.

## Public website checklist

- [ ] The homepage has a dedicated Google Calendar integration section.
- [ ] The homepage describes only features available in the current public or review build.
- [ ] Future calendar-management features are clearly marked as roadmap items until released.
- [ ] The Privacy Policy identifies the full Google Calendar scope and explains its purpose.
- [ ] The Privacy Policy distinguishes currently used functionality from technically possible but unreleased functionality.
- [ ] The Privacy Policy explains that Google Calendar data is used only for user-requested calendar functionality.
- [ ] The public website consistently identifies Musubi and its operator.
- [ ] The Google Play listing describes the Google Calendar integration available in the published build.
- [ ] A public account-deletion page explains both in-app deletion and the fallback request process.
- [ ] Repository links use the canonical `frgtn-dot-dev/musubi` location.

## Safe homepage copy before full calendar management is released

> Musubi can connect to one or more Google Calendar accounts and provide two-way event synchronization.
>
> With your permission, Musubi can display your Google calendars and their events, and create, update, or delete events when you perform those actions in Musubi. Synchronized data is processed by your Musubi server so that your calendars remain available across your devices and shared Musubi spaces.
>
> Musubi is being developed into a full calendar client. Management of Google calendar properties, calendar-list settings, and sharing permissions will be documented when those features become available.
>
> You can disconnect a Google account at any time. Disconnecting removes its stored credentials and synchronized copies of calendars and events from Musubi.

## Safe Privacy Policy copy before full calendar management is released

> Musubi requests the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` OAuth scope.
>
> This permission technically allows access to Google calendars, calendar settings, events, and sharing information. In the current version, Musubi uses it to list calendars and provide two-way synchronization of events. Musubi reads, creates, updates, and deletes events when requested by the user or when synchronization explicitly enabled by the user requires it.
>
> Functions for managing Google calendar resources, calendar-list settings, and sharing permissions are not used until the corresponding controls are available in the application. This policy will be updated when those features are released.
>
> Musubi uses Google Calendar data only to provide user-requested calendar functionality. It does not use the data for advertising, profiling, or unrelated purposes.

## Final scope justification draft

Use this only after the corresponding calendar-management features exist in the review build.

> Musubi uses the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` scope to provide a complete Google Calendar management and synchronization experience.
>
> Users can connect one or more Google accounts, view their calendar list, create and manage Google calendars, change calendar properties and calendar-list settings, and read, create, update, or delete events. Musubi respects the permissions reported by Google and disables actions that the user is not authorized to perform.
>
> The narrower `calendar.events` scope is not sufficient because Musubi manages calendar resources and user-specific calendar-list settings in addition to events. Read-only calendar-list access is not sufficient because users can change those settings from Musubi.
>
> All actions are initiated by the user through the Musubi interface or are part of synchronization explicitly enabled by the user. Google Calendar data is not used for advertising, profiling, or unrelated purposes.

## Demonstration video checklist

- [ ] Show the public Musubi homepage and Privacy Policy.
- [ ] Show the in-product disclosure before Google authorization.
- [ ] Record the complete Google consent flow in English.
- [ ] Show the connected calendar list and access roles.
- [ ] Create a secondary Google calendar in Musubi and verify it in Google Calendar.
- [ ] Edit calendar properties and verify the result in Google Calendar.
- [ ] Demonstrate a supported `calendarList` write operation.
- [ ] Import an existing Google event.
- [ ] Create, update, and delete an event from Musubi.
- [ ] Show that write controls are disabled for a read-only calendar.
- [ ] Delete the test secondary calendar.
- [ ] Disconnect the Google account and show removal of synchronized copies from Musubi.
- [ ] Add timestamps in the video description for each scope-dependent feature.

## Private verification material — do not commit

Keep these outside the public repository:

- Google Cloud project identifiers that are not already intentionally public;
- OAuth client secrets;
- access tokens, refresh tokens, authorization codes, and cookies;
- reviewer login credentials;
- test-user personal data;
- private build links or invitation codes;
- screenshots containing real calendars, email addresses, account IDs, or event content;
- internal infrastructure addresses, database details, encryption keys, or operational logs;
- unpublished security findings.

The public tracker may record that a private item is complete, but must not include the sensitive value or artifact.

## Decision log

- **2026-07-12:** Keep the full Google Calendar scope because Musubi is intended to become a full calendar client.
- **2026-07-12:** Do not justify the full scope using roadmap functionality alone.
- **2026-07-12:** Treat ACL management as optional for the first submission unless it is implemented and used in the justification.
- **2026-07-12:** Keep public website claims aligned with the review build.
- **2026-07-12:** Keep this tracker English-only and safe for a public repository.
