// The wire contract next door guards the *shape* of what crosses the wire. This
// guards the *address*. Renaming `/api/v1/calendars/:id/export` is invisible to
// every schema check in the repository and to the type system — the path is a
// string on one side and a string on the other — and it is a 404 for every
// phone build already installed, which cannot be patched.
//
// So: every `/api/…` URL that production code in apps/client or apps/web builds
// must resolve to a route registered in apps/api/src/index.ts.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT check: the HTTP method. A call site's method is
// often several lines from its URL, or passed in, and the break this exists to
// catch — a path that stopped existing — shows up in the path alone.
//
